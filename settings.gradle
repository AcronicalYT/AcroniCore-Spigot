 * TODO: Create a companion plugin that allows users to use the plugin as a dependency, instead of relying on sharding and maven.
 *  This will need a bit of work, as I need to essentially load each module as a static reference within the plugin, as well as initialising classes that require runtime access
 *  E.g. anything with init() methods that need to be registered with the server.
 *  This will mean I have to have fallbacks to make sure things are not registered multiple times (this shouldn't happen if I follow my own instructions)
